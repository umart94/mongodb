db.students.find().pretty();

a cursor is an object that allows to iterate through the documents of a Mongo collection. The behavior of cursor allows an automatic iteration across the results of the query; however, developers can explicitly go through the items returned in the cursor object.

Cursor offers:

A true snapshot of a system i.e. it returns the data in batches and increases the database performance
It saves system memory by allowing batch inserts and updates
Intelligibility and Clarity on the ad-hoc and complex queries of the sequential nature having large result sets and low consistency requirements
Openness to work on small batches of data as developers don’t need to wait for the processing and download of the complete record-set
