show dbs

Run the mongo command and log in to the MongoDB self-managed cluster.
you can see all the databases in a cluster that you have access to using the “show” command:


Note that admin and local are databases that are part of every MongoDB cluster.

From here on out there are only two tricky things to remember.

The first is that there isn’t a “create” command in the MongoDB shell.

To create a database you use the use command. If the database doesn’t exist, then the MongoDB cluster will create it.

In other words, a database is created when you try to use it with the “use” command.

But let’s say you entered the following command to create a new database:



use online-school
switched to db online-school

created and shifted to online-school

show dbs

will not show it, the newly created online-school db

so now , until we add something ( collection / document ) to database
it will not show up


db.students.insertOne({"name" : "umar", "age": 26, favourite_colors: ["green","silver"]});

> db.students.insertOne({"name" : "umar", "age": 26, favourite_colors: ["green","silver"]});
{
        "acknowledged" : true,
        "insertedId" : ObjectId("5facc4e4b5241764bcb1476f")
}

run command : 

show collections
it should show students


use <db>	Switch current database to <db>. The mongo shell variable db is set to the current database.



show users	Print a list of users for current database.
