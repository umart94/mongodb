by default a write operation is acknowledged as soon as data is written at
the primary , however that may result in data loss , if the primary goes down
before the data is replicated to the secondary nodes.

so, when we issue the write operation from the application client

we can specify a write concern of 2 or more nodes.

we can specify write concern majority to force the writes
to propagate to majority of the nodes regardless of the cluster size.

this is one of the reasons it is recommended, we have an odd number of nodes at each replication set
