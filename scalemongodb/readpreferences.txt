all read operations directed to primary to guarantee
strict consistency

we change this using read preference

when we issue the read request, we can set read preference to primaryPreferrred to still read from
the primary when its available..

or if primary is failed and new primary is not elected yet by secondary nodes then, we can still read from
secondary nodes that are not too much out of sync

if number of reads is too much for primary

and we do not use strict consistency

BUT INSTEAD OF STRICT CONSISTENCY, WE USE EVENTUAL CONSISTENCY THEN WE CAN USE THE SECONDARY READ PREFERENCE WITH THE READ OPERATION.


if we deploy the replication set nodes to seperate physical locations, we can specify the read preference to be "nearest" to read from the node that has the lowest latency , to our application client.

this may also read  stale data , however this is a 
tradeoff in this approach.
