mongodb replication sets
read preferences
write semantics

we wrote data and read data through
Application Client ( command prompt  - mongoshell ) to mongodb using a single instance of mongodb.

all through single node.

to provide data redundancy and availability. , and resilience to failures
of individual nodes. we are going to replicate our data by launching
multiple instances of mongodb


A GROUP OF MONGODB INSTANCES  , THAT CONTAIN THE SAME DATA IS CALLED A 
REPLICATION SET.



inside a replication set, 1 node is primary ( that holds the data written to it) and the rest are secondary nodes, this is a variation of the master slave architecture.   


by default , all reads and writes go to the primary node
the secondary nodes constantly sync with the primary node to stay upto date

if primary node fails
the secondary nodes detect that and hold an election to elect the new primary node

until that election completes , no write operation can be acknowledged.
once the old primary node recovers, it can join back either as a primary or
as a secondary depending on our configuration.
