mongodb is a scalable , nosql Document oriented database


what document Document oriented database means is that
instead of storing data in tables like sql we store data in database
directly in json format

mongodb stores data in a format called BSON Serialization.


think of a row in a sql database table as a OBJECT/DOCUMENT in mongodb.

the columns in sql record can be thought of as fields 
in the mongodb document

the primary key in sql is equivalent to _id ObjectId in Mongodb

a table in sql is equivalent to a Collection in MongoDB

SQL				NOSQL
ROW 			 OBJECT/DOCUMENT
COLUMNS				FIELDS
PRIMARY KEY			ID / OBJECTID
TABLE				COLLECTION



MONGODB CRUD operations :

CREATE
READ
UPDATE
DELETE

in same way as sql, the exception is that the document's "_id" is immutable and cannot be changed after document's creation.



CREATE:

1. db.collection.insertOne(object) - insert one document

db.collection.insertOne(
   <document>,
   {
      writeConcern: <document>
   }
)


2. db.collection.insertMany([object1,object2,object3,.....]) - insert multiple documents

3.Read

db.collection.find(filter) - read a document

4. Update

db.collection.updateOne(filter,update action) - update a single document
db.collection.updateMany(filter, update action) - update all documents that match.
db.collection.replaceOne(filter,replacement) - replaces a single document


5. Delete

db.collection.deleteOne(filter) - removes a single document from a collection
db.collection.deleteMany(filter) - removes all documents that match a filter
